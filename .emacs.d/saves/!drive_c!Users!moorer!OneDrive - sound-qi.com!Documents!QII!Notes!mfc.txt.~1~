TutorialsPoint: MFC (see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mfc/index.htm): Getting Started:
Create Project Using Project Templates:
-Create MFCDemo choosing "Dialog based" and unchecking all options like "Thick frame", "Minimize box", "Maximize box" etc.

TutorialsPoint: MFC (see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mfc/index.htm): Windows Fundamentals:

WINDOW CREATION:
-Create an app you must derive from MFC`s CWinApp (which stands for "Class for a Windows Application")

MFCDemo.h contains:

class CMFCDemoApp : public CWinApp
{
public:
	CMFCDemoApp();

// Overrides
public:
	virtual BOOL InitInstance();

// Implementation

	DECLARE_MESSAGE_MAP()
};

extern CMFCDemoApp theApp;

-We also need a frame/window to show the content of our application

class CMyFrame :
	public CFrameWnd
{
public:
	CMyFrame() {
		Create(NULL, _T("MFC Application Tutorial"));
	}
};

MAIN WINDOW:
-You can use a pointer to show the class used to create a window of type CFrameWnd.

class CExample : public CWinApp {
   BOOL InitInstance() {
      CMyFrame *Frame = new CMyFrame();  m_pMainWnd = Frame;
      
      Frame->ShowWindow(SW_NORMAL);
      Frame->UpdateWindow();
      
      return TRUE;
   }
};

-If you change the code to the following then no minimize, maximize or close buttons will be available anymore:

class CMyFrame :
	public CFrameWnd
{
public:
	CMyFrame() {
		Create(NULL, _T("MFC Application Tutorial"), WS_VISIBLE | WS_OVERLAPPED);
	}
};

WINDOWS LOCATION:
-You can use cartesian coordinates with the origin being in the top left corner of the screen to set or obtain a window`s location:
-Win32 has this:

typedef struct tagPOINT {
   LONG x;
   LONG y;
} POINT;

-Also MFC has a CPoint class:

CPoint();
CPoint(int X, int Y);

WINDOWS SIZE:
-Win32 has this:
typedef struct tagSIZE {
   int cx;
   int cy;
} SIZE;

-MFC also has:

CSize();
CSize(int initCX, int initCY);
CSize(SIZE initSize);
CSize(POINT initPt);
CSize(DWORD dwSize);

WINDOWS DIMENSIONS:
-Win32 has this:
typedef struct _RECT {
   LONG left;
   LONG top;
   LONG right;
   LONG bottom;
} RECT, *PRECT;

-MFC also provides this:

CRect();
CRect(int l, int t, int r, int b);
CRect(const RECT& srcRect);
CRect(LPCRECT lpSrcRect);
CRect(POINT point, SIZE size);
CRect(POINT topLeft, POINT bottomRight);

-Here is how you can specify the size and location of the window:

class CMyFrame :
	public CFrameWnd
{
public:
	CMyFrame() {
		Create(NULL, _T("MFC Application Tutorial"), WS_SYSMENU, CRect(90, 120,
			550, 480));
	}
};

WINDOWS PARENTS:
-The first window created becomes the parent and can be specified with the pParentWnd argument of CFrameWnd::Create()
-Since no parent is specified for the startup window we set the parameter to NULL:

class CMyFrame : public CFrameWnd {
   public:
      CMyFrame() {
         Create(NULL, _T("MFC Application Tutorial"), WS_SYSMENU, 
            CRect(90, 120, 550, 480), NULL);
      }
};

TutorialsPoint: MFC - Dialog Boxes(see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mfc/mfc_dialog_boxes.htm): 
-CDialog class is used here where the construction is composed of 2 steps:
1) Construct the dialog object
2) Create the dialog window

-Let us demonstrate by creating a new project with "MFC in Shared DLL"
-Create a new class:

#include <afxwin.h>

class CExample : public CWinApp {
   public:
      BOOL InitInstance();
};

Dialog Box Creation:
1) Right-click on the "Resource Files" and choose "Add Resource"
2) Choose Dialog and click New
3) Now you should see the resource file MFCDialogDemo.rc with it being opened in a designer.  You could also open it in a text editor.
4) Check the properties and ensure that the dialog box is identified such as with:

    IDD_EXAMPLE_DLG

Dialog Location:
-Location is specified by X position and Y position

Dialog Box Dimensions:
...

Dialog Box Methods:
-Here are the constructors:

   CDialog();
   CDialog(UINT nIDTemplate, CWnd* pParentWnd = NULL);
   CDialog(LPCTSTR lpszTemplateName, CWnd* pParentWnd = NULL);

-Let us create a new class:

class CExampleDlg : public CDialog {
   public:
      enum { IDD = IDD_EXAMPLE_DLG };
   
      CExampleDlg();
      ~CExampleDlg();
};

CExampleDlg::CExampleDlg():CDialog(CExampleDlg::IDD) {

}

CExampleDlg::~CExampleDlg() {

}

-Now we need to instantiate CExampleDlg:

BOOL CExample::InitInstance() {
   CExampleDlg myDlg;
   m_pMainWnd = &myDlg;
   
   return TRUE;
}

Modal Dialog Boxes: Modeless Dialog Box:
-You must provide a public ctor and then call Create to load the dialog resource
-If the dialog resource has WS_VISIBLE then the dialog appears immediately otherwise you must call the ShowWindow function

Modal Dialog Boxes: Modal Dialog Box:
-To use this call a ctor and then call the DoModal method

BOOL CExample::InitInstance() {
   CExampleDlg myDlg;
   m_pMainWnd = &myDlg;
   myDlg.DoModal();
   return TRUE;
}

-----

-Here is the full implementation:

#include <afxwin.h>
#include "resource.h"

class CExample : public CWinApp {
   public:
      BOOL InitInstance();
};
   
class CExampleDlg : public CDialog {
   public:
      enum { IDD = IDD_EXAMPLE_DLG };
   
      CExampleDlg();
     ~CExampleDlg();
};

CExampleDlg::CExampleDlg():CDialog(CExampleDlg::IDD) {

}

CExampleDlg::~CExampleDlg() {

}

BOOL CExample::InitInstance() {
   CExampleDlg myDlg;
   m_pMainWnd = &myDlg;
   myDlg.DoModal();
   return TRUE;
}
CExample MyApp;
