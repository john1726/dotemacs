I. Intro to Seismic Interpretation with Carl Reine (se Intro to Seismic Interpretation Carl Reine.m4v):
What Seismic Is: 
-Rocks are separated into layers 
-We have a seismic source which is an explosion, and then a seismic receiver
-You get a trace, with your wave bouncing back at you 
-You also have other issues where a truck driving would produce noise 
-If you have many receivers, then you have a lot of offsets 
-Another way to look at it is to consider a point down in the earth  
-Then with all of the shots and receivers you have the same midpoint (this is called a common midpoint gather)
-This is a prestack gather  
-We need to figure out how to configure velocities to get to depth 
-The data gets sent to processors, which do some things to remove some noise  
-You can correct for time, which is called normal moveout correction (NMO)

Prestack Gathers:
-This is what your raw data might look like 
-In the reds, you are seeing peaks 
-If you are compressing the ground, and you have an increase in velocity (reds)
-If you decrease the velocity, this is called an expansion (blue)
-How bright or dim they are, you have how different ...
-Along this green, your amplitudes at the near offset are not as ... as your far offsets 
-If you look at the shape of that AVO curve, that tells you a lot about the properties of the earth  

RF is just he amplitude of these reflections, Vp vs Vs  

-A P wave (primary wave) is a compressional 
-How fast it moves out is your P-wave velocity 
-Shear wave is the S-wave 
-The Shear wave, instead of it being a compression and expansion of particles, is particles moving back and forth 

Equation:
-When we talk about P-impedance  

-Impedance is just a fancy way of saying velocity times density 
-The reflectivity equation ..., the change in P-impadance, S-impedance, and desntiy ...we can get the properties back, and relate those to geology 
-Shale which is quite soft is quite slow 
-A limestone carbonate is very fast  
-Shales don`t have a lot of space so they make poor reservoise 
-Sandstones have more pores so they make better reservoirs  
-Another thing we look at is clay content  
-If you go behinda coral reef, you have bits of shell, and those combine to make a rock  
-Calcite mineral has almost no pore space so they would not make a  good reservoir 

Vp/Vs is good at showing if you have a high clay content 
P-impedance is good for showing if you have a high porosity 

-You look at the Xplot and you see different clusters 
-High Vp/Vs 
-High P-impedance is usually stiffer rocks like sandstone 

-We work with the gathers, but most interpreters work with the stack

I. Intro to Seismic Interpretation with Carl Reine Part 2:
What Makes a Seismic Reflection and What Changes Occur?
-On each layer, certain sound bounces back, and certain portion goes deeper.
-How do we know how much bounces back, and how much goes deeper?

Let R_0 = reflection coefficient
ρ = density
V = Velocity

      V'p' * ρ_p - Vpρ_p
R_0 = --------------------
      V'p' * ρ_p + Vpρ_p
	 
Where V'p' = I_p (p-Impedance)

-Each trace is one spot on the survey

Rock Properties:
-Rock grains: Made of different minerals, quarts, calcite, limestone, or clay
-What goes on in between the mineral grains?  Most of the time it is filled with water.
-The first layer in the ground is soil.  Pore space in soil is normally filled with air.
-The next layer has pore spaces usually filled with water.
-Eventually at a deeper layer you will get organic shales which are heavy clay-rich minerals.  This is organic rich which is plant or animal which eventuall. becomes oil.  Peat bogs that get squished can turn into goal.
-Coral reefs that get squished can turn into oil and gas.  Whether it turns into oil, gas or coal is determined partly by the amount of pressure.
-Oil which is lighter than water pushes up until it hits a rock layer than it cannot get past.
-Same thing with gas--gas is going to bubble up.
-We need to figure out, what is causing these amplitude to change, is it what is in the rock?
-When companies are drilling wells they are trying to target traps.
-Oil and water are going to change the rock properties differently
